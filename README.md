# Shortest-Path-MILP
SAS MILP model for optimizing fuel transportation between refineries and stations. The model minimizes transportation and distance costs while ensuring supply and demand constraints are met, using continuous and binary decision variables. Minimizes unit and distance-based costs while meeting capacities, demands, and minimum shipment thresholds.
